This is a small program that can randomly call learners. 
In the source code, you will see a lot of random generation by the machine. 
You can totally change these things as per requirement of yours.

## The Good Old Days
PureBasic was my first ever programming language, so it reminds me of the good old days. 
Before PureBasic, I first learned Excel formulas, which really captured my interest. 
The very first time I encountered Excel was in college,
and it was the IF function presented by the professor that really caught my attention.
